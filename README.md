Coursework for the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Course

###Project: Getting Your Feet Wet With Rails
As I'd already done all the installation/tutorial work that made up the early part of this lesson back in 101, I've just posted my app from Chapter 2 of The Rails Tutorial. Nothing much to show, ,though.

* SQL Zoo - Assignment: [The Odin Project - SQL](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/sql). I started logging my solutions to the tutorial problems from the 4th round.
* Micro-reddit - Assignment: [The Odin Project - Active Record Basics](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record)
* Re-former - Assignment: [The Odin Project - Forms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/forms)
* Members-only - Assignment: [The Odin Project - Authentication](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication)

I've added the SampleApp from Michael Hartl's railstutorial.org as of this commit. I've completed the full tutorial/app, and am now backtracking and working through some of the additional exercises he provided. You can see the app at:
